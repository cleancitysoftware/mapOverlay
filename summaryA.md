# Seattle Downtown Mapping Application - Project Summary A

## Overview
Built a sophisticated pedestrian path-building application for downtown Seattle using Effect TS, Vite, and Leaflet with real OpenStreetMap routing.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: Vite + TypeScript
- **Type System**: Effect TS with compile-time type checking
- **Mapping**: Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Routing**: Leaflet Routing Machine + OSRM walking profiles
- **Data Source**: OpenStreetMap via Overpass API

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Interactive Map Interface
- High-resolution downtown Seattle map (zoom level 19)
- Street-level detail showing sidewalks and building outlines
- Click-to-place waypoints for path building

### 2. Pedestrian-Focused Routing
- **Real walking routes**: Uses `routing.openstreetmap.de/routed-foot/` for true pedestrian routing
- **Crosswalk support**: Routes directly across streets instead of around blocks
- **Sidewalk awareness**: Follows actual pedestrian infrastructure

### 3. Segment-Based Path Building
- **Sequential waypoint placement**: Click start → add waypoints step-by-step
- **Visual segment management**: Each path segment tracked separately
- **Color-coded states**:
  - Green = Current editable segment
  - Blue = Previous locked segments
  - Red = Selected/highlighted segment
- **Segment list UI**: Click segments to highlight and zoom to them

### 4. Walkable Infrastructure Visualization
- **Toggle overlay**: "Show All Walkable Paths" checkbox (defaults ON)
- **Live OSM data**: Fetches pedestrian infrastructure via Overpass API
- **Color-coded path types**:
  - Orange = Footways & pedestrian areas
  - Red (dashed) = Crosswalks
  - Purple = Steps/stairs
  - Green = General paths
  - Blue = Streets with sidewalks

### 5. Advanced Path Management
- **Path simplicity**: Previous segments lock to prevent recomputation complexity
- **Current segment editing**: Only most recent segment allows drag-to-edit
- **Clear/restart functionality**: Easy path management tools

## Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. Routing Server Issues
**Problem**: Initial OSRM demo server (`router.project-osrm.org`) only provided car routing even when requesting walking profiles, causing city-wide detours for simple crosswalk routes.

**Solution**: Switched to `routing.openstreetmap.de/routed-foot/` which properly supports pedestrian routing with `foot-walking` profile.

### 2. Dynamic Route Styling
**Problem**: Leaflet Routing Machine controls couldn't be easily restyled after creation, causing crashes when trying to highlight segments.

**Solution**: Used temporary polyline overlays for highlighting instead of recreating routing controls.

### 3. Real-Time Walkway Data
**Problem**: Needed to show all available pedestrian paths and crosswalks for route planning.

**Solution**: Integrated Overpass API queries to fetch live OSM pedestrian infrastructure data with proper error handling.

```

## Key Learnings
1. **OSRM Demo Limitations**: Standard OSRM demo servers don't support walking profiles
2. **Alternative Routing Services**: `routing.openstreetmap.de` provides proper multi-modal routing
3. **Leaflet Control Management**: Better to use overlay layers than recreate routing controls
4. **OSM Data Quality**: High-quality pedestrian infrastructure data available via Overpass API

## Current State
- ✅ Functional pedestrian routing with crosswalk support
- ✅ Visual walkway overlay system
- ✅ Segment-based path building with highlighting
- ✅ High-zoom street-level interface
- ✅ Type-safe Effect TS integration

## Future Enhancements (Planned)
- Enhanced drag-to-edit with better snap-to-grid
- Path distance/time calculations
- Export/save functionality
- Performance optimizations for large route sets
- Additional walkway types and filtering
- Mobile responsiveness improvements

## Demo Usage
1. Load page → walkable paths appear automatically
2. Click "Start New Path" 
3. Click anywhere to place waypoints
4. Routes follow real pedestrian paths and crosswalks
5. Click segments in sidebar to highlight/zoom to them
6. Toggle walkway overlay on/off as needed

**Result**: A sophisticated pedestrian navigation tool that understands real-world walking infrastructure and provides intuitive path-building capabilities for downtown Seattle.
